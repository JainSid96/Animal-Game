AnimalGame README:

This is the animalGame, written in C and implemented with serialization. It relies on four files:

animalGame.c: The animalGame interface. Handles transition from node to node, and interactions with user.

binaryTree.c: Implements a binary tree, where each node contains a void* pointer to user-defined contents. Can serialize (write trees to and read trees from files), but serialization is currently only enabled with trees containing string contents.

basicIO.c: Includes basic IO functions for getting yes/no responses and getting questions and animal names.

queue.c: Implements a queue (based on Professor Kurtz' example from lecture) because the binaryTree implementation depends on queues for saving and loading trees.
